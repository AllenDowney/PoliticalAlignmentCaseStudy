## Political Alignment Case Study

This repository contains a data science case study that explores the relationship between political alignment (conservative, moderate, or liberal) and other attitudes and beliefs.  It is meant primarily for teaching and learning about data science, but we might do some real research along the way.

If you are working through [the *Elements of Data Science* curriculum](https://allendowney.github.io/ElementsOfDataScience/), you should be ready to start this case study when you have completed Notebook 6, which covers basic Pandas.

This material is a work in progress, so your feedback is welcome.  The best way to provide that feedback is to [click here and create an issue in this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AllenDowney/PoliticalAlignmentCaseStudy/issues).


## The notebooks

For each of the notebooks below, you have two options: if you view the notebook on NBViewer, you can read it, but you can't run the code.  If you run the notebook on Colab, you'll be able to run the code, do the exercises, and save your modified version of the notebook in a Google Drive (if you have one).

### Notebook 1

**Cleaning and validation**: The first notebook loads data from the General Social Survey (GSS) and walks through the process of cleaning and validating the data.  At the end, you can help me by choosing a random variable, checking the values against the codebook, and reporting your results.
