    "### Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before working with any dataset, it is important to validate it, which means checking for errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kinds of errors you have to check for depend on the nature of the data, the collection process, how the data is stored and transmitted, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this dataset, there a few kinds of validation we'll think about:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We need to check the integrity of the dataset; that is, whether the data were corrupted or changed during transmission, storage, or conversion from one format to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We need to check our interpretation of the data; for example, whether we replaced the right codes for missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) We will also keep an eye out for data, or patterns, that might indicate problems with the survey process and the recording of the data.  For example, in a different dataset I worked with, I found a surprising number of respondents whose height was supposedly 62 centimeters.  After investigating, I concluded that they were probably 6 feet, 2 inches, and their heights were recorded incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validating data can be a tedious process, but it is important.  If you interpret data incorrectly and publish invalid results, you will be embarrassed in the best case, and in the worst case you might do serious harm.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we don't expect you to validate every variable in this dataset.  Instead, we will demonstrate the process, and then ask you to validate one additional variable as an exercise.\n",
    "\n",
